// Q45: Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object.
// The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It
// should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function
// with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a
// color or an optional feature. 
// Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was
// stored correctly?

//Answer 45:
type Car_Obj = {
    manufacturer: string;
    model: string;
    [key: string]: any
}
//car function:
let CarDetails = (manifactur: string, model: string, ...detail: [string, any][]):
Car_Obj => {
    let carData: Car_Obj = {manufacturer: manifactur,model: model}
    for(let [key, value] of detail){carData[key] = value}
    return carData;
}

console.log(CarDetails("Chrysler", "ME412"));

console.log(CarDetails("Corvette", "Z06", ["color", "gold"]));
