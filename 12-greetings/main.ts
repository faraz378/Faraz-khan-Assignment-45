// Q12: Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s
// name,print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be
// personalized with the person’s name?

// Answer 12:
let name_siblings = ["Fahad","Umair","Faizan","Ammar","ubaid","naveed"]
//For Of Loop:
for (let i of name_siblings){console.log(`Greetings Sir! ${i}`)}
