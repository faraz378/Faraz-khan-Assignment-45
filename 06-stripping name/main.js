// Q6:Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end 
// of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name
//once,so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white spaces?

let person_name = "\t Faraz Khan \n";
