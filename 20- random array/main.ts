// Q20: Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains,
// rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates
// a list containing these items?

// Answer 20:
console.log("\n")
let randomArray = ["K2","Hawksbay","Turkey","Doha","Typescript"]
console.log(randomArray,"\n","\nList: ");
// List:
randomArray.map((i) => {console.log(i)})
